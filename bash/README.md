## Memory usage script in Bash

<!-- This script is designed to monitor the memory consumption of a system and generate an alarm by sending an HTTP request to an API when the memory usage exceeds a specified threshold. -->

```
git clone git@github.com:AntonioKampf/Memory-control-script-task.git

## Dependencies

```


## Usage

To run the script with default parameters (80% of memory and http://127.0.0.1:8080/alarm), use the following command:

To specify the memory usage and request URL, use the following command:
