# Memory usage scripts

These scripts are designed to monitor the RAM and ROM usage of a system. When the memory usage exceeds a specified threshold, an alarm is generated by sending an HTTP request to an API. You can retrieve and store these alarms using [Memory_control_server](https://github.com/ASivashs/Memory_control_server).

### Please refer to the instructions and requirements located in the directories with the scripts for more details on how to use them. ðŸš€
